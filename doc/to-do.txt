TODO:

- complain about superfluous instruction arguments
- filter options: sick, leave
- instruction 'identity' <short_name> (<name_bit>)* (or 'id') to specify who the following day data is for
- a project manager might want to ignore activities for other projects
  (the definitions of which he might not have access to) => ignore-wp-ref (ignore-work-package-reference)
- test case for above in imports
- user-friendly time range option handling
- find alternative to PyLint
- check for negative times or 0.0?
- flag comments on non-commentable instructions as errors when parsing
- option to show daily/weekly/monthly allocation to work-packages over a period of time
- work package status: pristine, active, assigned, done, percentages
- make reset and friends commentable?
- sort activities chronologically at the end of a file read; ascending/descending

- test cases for directives: reset, etc. + fix reset (do we need dump here?)
- test cases for rubbish files

- manual: explain leave and sick plausibility check
- manual: explain what a ; comment applies to
- manual: list all error messages and explain them
- manual: \setmathfont{Asana Math} ?
- manual: file format -- log comments
- manual: file format -- describe reset and friends
- manual: emacs example for error message parsing?
- manual: mention option -f means 'filter'
- manual: tf offers different reports (digests?)

DONE:

- manual: leave and sick instructions can be used without parameter
- manual: clarify which instructions appear in day block and which don't
- leave and sick instructions can be used without parameter which implies they mean the whole day
- leave and sick plausibility checking
- fix "leave 2012-02-05 2012-02-12 blabla"
- fix "sick 2012-02-05 2012-02-12 yoyo"
- count the errors when reading
- add must-hours to example on title page
- manual: 3.2.13: This allows you to e.g. ... or ... or ... -> ..., ... or ...
- if day check succeeds without problems, it should print 'ok' at the end
- test case multiple work package auto-merge
- test case multiple day record auto-merge
- test case duplicate day start-stop
- accept day ranges in must-hours so one can write e.g. must-hours mon..fri=8- put link to change log on main page
- activity: first complain about invalid wp, then about invalid time
- manual: 2.1 source comment -> emph
- manual: space/tab examples 4, 5: show timeflies error messages
- day check output: add summary line at the end
- manual: explain indentation space/tab rule
- warn if work package indentation uses both space and tab characters
- test case with unevenly (but correctly) indented work packages
- test cases for bad tab/space prefixes in lines
- if a file cannot be opened, don't add it to bill-of-materials list
- tidy up dump options in alltests.py
- move dump options from Reader to Universe
- tidy up wrap-input.py
- indent files in bill-of-materials output
- work space hierarchies: check leading tab/space validity (leading whitespace of two consecutive lines must match)
- manual: journal
- manual: time tracking vs. time keeping, time planning; A Tool for Planning and Tracking Time?
- manual: is more of a digester/analyser than a stop-watch
- show public holidays only on days with must hours != 0
- check for duplicate day items (day blocks read twice) and flag them as errors
- non-existent input files now have proper error messages instead of stack traces
- packager: remove .py from timeflies script
- manual: timeflies.pl -> timeflies
- use lambda in leave/sick block maker
- set must-work hours per day
- rename block leave (with start and end dates) to leave-days
- got rid of TODO -- was: to do items are no errors!
- manual: put email address in title
- manual: put software version in title
- instruction 'must-hours' to set required working hours per day; this is valid from the day it is attached to
- day check output: bring date format in line with time at work overview output
- Day.comments init as None
- change import logic and allow to re-import files (only look at the stack when checking for loops)
- instruction 'import' to import another file
- include off comment in day output and fix day output comment handling for leave and sick
- public-holiday (phol) <date>[; <comment>] 
- make 'off' commentable
- day check output: 'tasked' = 'allocated', remove '***'
- make leave, sick commentable
- leave-days: tidy up arg list length check
- replace -- by ; as universal non-source comment marker
- ...dump_node() if else expression check for None and swap sides
- make ';' the activity or work package comment delimiter so ',' has no double meaning
